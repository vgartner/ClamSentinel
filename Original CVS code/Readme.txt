Clam Sentinel is a real-time scanner for ClamWin.
For Windows 98/98SE/ME/2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7 and Windows 8.

Clam Sentinel requires the installation of ClamWin http://www.clamwin.com/

Clam Sentinel is a system tray program that detects file system changes and scans
the files modified using ClamWin (Clamscan.exe).
Also detects new drives added (like usb pen) and monitors these units until the
program is closed or until the device is disconnected.

For update Clam Sentinel from the zip file (without installation) stop the current
version of Sentinel before install it or unzip it to the Sentinel directory.
The sentinel.exe file can't be replaced while Sentinel is running.

Clam Sentinel for default put infected files into the quarantine folder but you can
change it from the Advanced Settings menu'.

Clam Sentinel has been tested on Windows 98SE, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

Clam Sentinel is developed with Delphi Win32 (Delphi 4 or more, until to Delphi 2005)
and the source code is available on Sourceforge http://clamsentinel.cvs.sourceforge.net/

The file Sentinel.vxd is used only on Win98.
