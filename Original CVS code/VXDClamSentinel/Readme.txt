For to build this code you must to use MSVC 6.0 (or 5.0) + Win98DDK.

First you must to install MSVC, then the Win98DDK.

When you have installed Win98DDK you can to use the "Free Build Environment shell" that you can find on Start->Programs->Development Kits->Windows 98 DDK.

When the shell is started go to the folder where you have the sources and build all with an nmake /f makefile command.

I have installed MSVC 6.0 + Win98DDK on my XP Home machine and I can to build well the code, but remember that a vxd don't runs on XP.

The Windows 98 DDK is not more availables from Microsoft web site, but you can find it on internet (search 98ddk.exe) or here http://www.mdgx.com/add.htm#DDK .
