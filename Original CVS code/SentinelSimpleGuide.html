<H3 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER>The Clam Sentinel Program
Description And Setup</H3>
<P>Clam Sentinel lets you use ClamWin Antivirus as a resident scanner
as files are added, modified, or copied to your computer. It scans
permanent hard drives, network drives, and USB/removable drives with
ClamWin, and Clam Sentinel also uses its own system monitor to detect
unknown malware that does not have a ClamWin signature. Clam Sentinel
is designed especially for older computers, such as Windows 98, ME,
2000, and XP, but it has been tested on Windows Vista/Windows
7/Windows 8 machines and works fine on them also.</P>
<P>Both Clam Sentinel and ClamWin are free, open source
programs.<BR>Clam Sentinel can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamsentinel/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/clamsentinel/</A>
on the web.<BR>ClamWin can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/content/view/18/46/">http://www.clamwin.com/content/view/18/46/</A>
on the web.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>INSTALLATION</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">ClamWin must be installed/configured
on the computer before Clam Sentinel can be installed. The Clam
Sentinel installation setup will remind you to stop and exit an old
version of Sentinel during installation. The new installation will
keep your old Clam Sentinel configuration settings and add any new
settings needed.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You should use C:\Program
Files\ClamSentinel for the Sentinel installation directory. If your
Clam Sentinel download file is the ClamSentinel.exe file, download or
copy the .exe file to this directory and click on it to install. If
your Sentinel download file is a zipped file, unzip it to this same
directory, and click on the ClamSentinel.exe file to install. If your
unzip program tells you that a file is already in the directory, tell
it to replace the old file and all files. During installation, select
Run on startup if it is offered, so that Sentinel will start in
real-time mode on your computer. Select to use Sentinel for all users
if asked during the install.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You must stop and exit Clam Sentinel
before installing a new version of ClamWin. Be sure to start Clam
Sentinel after the new ClamWin version is installed.</P>
<P><B>Language Support</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Clam Sentinel automatically supports
the default language on the computer if it is English, French,
Italian, Japanese, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Portuguese,
Bulgarian, Azeri, Dutch, Indonesian, Hindu, and Galician. English is
used as the default for all other languages. You can force Sentinel
to use any of these languages by adding a row to the Sentinel .ini
configuration file like this: Language = French. Do not use a period.
Lines in the .ini file without a semicolon at the start are active.
All other lines are just explanations. 
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">If you would like to help the
Clam Sentinel project by translating the program into a new language,
download this file:
<A HREF="http://clamsentinel.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clamsentinel/ClamSentinel/Languages.txt">http://clamsentinel.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clamsentinel/ClamSentinel/Languages.txt</A>
from the web and then do the translation and send the translation
file to: </SPAN><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">dynclient@users.sourceforge.net</SPAN></I>
</P>
<P><B>Uninstalling</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You can uninstall Clam Sentinel from
the Windows Start menu, by selecting Start, All Programs, Clam
Sentinel. You can also uninstall via the Windows Control Panel or via
the Uninstall program in the Sentinel directory.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>**QUICK GUIDE TO CLAM SENTINEL CONFIGURATION AND
OPERATION**</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>All Clam Sentinel
configuration is done by right or left clicking the Clam Sentinel
icon badge in the Windows system tray. We suggest that you use the
default settings that are already configured.  Under settings choose
to write scan activity to logs, detect and monitor new drives, ask to
scan new drives, quarantine infected files, and detect suspicious
files only. Under Advanced Settings, choose to monitor C drive,
network drives, and any other hard disks/removable drives you may
have.  USBs are usually drives F and G. Download files only from
trusted web sites, do not use cracked software, do not visit porn
sites or torrent sites, and do not put personal information on social
networking sites.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Infected file detections
are ClamWin detections. You must send files that are falsely detected
as infected to Clam AV for signature correction. Suspicious file
detections are Clam Sentinel system monitor detections. You must
whitelist any falsely detected suspicious files in Clam Sentinel&mdash;Clam
AV can do nothing about them. Whitelisting excludes a file from
scanning by Clam Sentinel.  You can whitelist files in Advanced
Settings, Paths Or Files Not Scanned. Read the section below on Paths
Or Files Not Scanned for information about whitelisting.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>To minimize Clam Sentinel
false positive detections, set up a download folder and whitelist the
folder in Clam Sentinel as a path or file not to be scanned. Download
all files to the download folder before you run/install them. Scan
each file with ClamWin and then with another AV or Jotti or
VirusTotal before you install/run it. If the file is okay, then
install/run it. If Clam Sentinel detects a file as suspicious, always
scan it with ClamWin and then with another AV or Jotti or Virus
Total. If the file is okay, disable the system monitor, whitelist the
file, restore the quarantined file via the Sentinel Recover program,
and re-enable the system monitor. If a suspicious file is also
detected by another AV, upload the file to Clam AV so they can
prepare a signature for both Clam AV and ClamWin. Read the rest of
this guide for more complete information about Clam Sentinel
operation.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="orphans: 132"><B>CLAM SENTINEL DETAILED
OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS</B></P>
<P><B>SETTINGS OPTIONS</B></P>
<P><B>Memory Scan</B></P>
<P>The first settings option is Scan the memory when the program
starts. This is the same as ClamWin's memory scan. You will probably
not want to activate this option. You can always scan memory with
ClamWin manually or during a ClamWin scheduled scan. 
</P>
<P><B>Write scan activity to the log </B>
</P>
<P>The next option is Write scan activity to the log. Sentinel has 5
scan logs for real-time, memory, USB/removable drive, messages about
new malware/suspicious changes, and quarantine. All logs are
activated by this one selection. For most users, the message log and
quarantine logs are probably the most important. The real-time log is
very active when you are on the world wide web.</P>
<P><B>Detect And Monitor New Drives</B></P>
<P>This option is for detection on removable drives (USB, etc.) You
should choose to detect new drives, but scanning takes some time, so
you would probably not want to scan new drives unless you are using a
USB drive for the first time. You can scan a USB manually with
ClamWin.</P>
<P><B>Ask To Scan New Drives</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You can choose this option tom make
Sentinel ask if you want to scan a USB (or another) removable drive
when it is inserted. Scan all new USB drives that you have not used
before.</P>
<P><B>Infected File Options</B></P>
<P>The next option is What to do when an infected file is found.
There are two choices: Move to quarantine or Report Only. Choosing
quarantine is best. ClamWin and Sentinel have protection from false
positive detections on Windows system files. You can restore false
positives from quarantine via the Sentinel Recover program. Use the
Report Only option if you are not sure what to choose, but you will
have to manually quarantine infected files or and manually remove
files from quarantine..</P>
<P><B>Monitor System For New Malware Options</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The next option is Monitor system for
new malware. There are several System Monitor options: Detect
suspicious files and warn about system changes, Detect suspicious
files only, and Disable. There is also an option to Skip files with a
valid digital signature. When Sentinel detects a suspicious file, it
is put in quarantine (if you choose the quarantine option). The type
of suspicious detection included in the filename. Suspicious files
that are quarantined should be sent to Clam AV at
http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/sendvirus/ so Clam can prepare a normal
signature for all users.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Do not select the option to Detect
suspicious files and warn about system changes unless you are an
experienced user who wants to know about all changes to your computer
system. Users who select this option will see many popup messages
about system changes (files put on the computer). Most system changes
are okay and should not be a concern.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The option to &ldquo;Detect suspicious
files only&rdquo; is the default option and is recommended for most
users. When this option is chosen, the System Monitor will give popup
warning messages only when new suspicious files have been detected.
There will be no popup warnings of other system changes, but an entry
will still be made in the Message Log for the record. Send
quarantined suspicious files to Clam AV for normal signature
preparation. Whitelist Sentinel suspicious files that are false
positive detections as explained below.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The option to Disable the System
Monitor turns off detection of suspicious files. You can Disable the
system monitor while you &ldquo;whitelist&rdquo; a file, but
re-enable it after you whitelist the file and restore it from
quarantine via the Sentinel Recover program. If you have problems
using the System Monitor, choose the Disable option and inform the
Sentinel developer. The System Monitor provides important extra
protection for malware that does not have a ClamWin virus signature.
When the System Monitor is disabled, there will be a red mark in the
lower right portion of the Clam Sentinel badge in the Windows system
tray.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Even if you practice &ldquo;safe
surfing&rdquo; on the world wide web, the System Monitor may give an
occasional false positive warning when downloading &ldquo;good&rdquo;
files. Read the Quick Guide to Clam Sentinel Configuration and
Operation about how to handle false positives<FONT SIZE=3><B>.</B></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Upload quarantined suspicious
files to Clam AV at <A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/sendvirus/">http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/sendvirus/</A>
on the web for normal virus signature preparation. If you check files
with Jotti or Virus Total on the web, a suspicious file that is not
detected by more than 3 AV programs is likely a &ldquo;false
positive&rdquo; especially if the file is older than a week or two.
See whitelisting elsewhere to learn how to exclude false positive
files.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">If you get a suspicious warning when
you are not installing a new program, malware may be trying to
install itself on your computer. If you are not installing/running a
new program and you get a warning about a suspicious file, a warning
about a registry change, or several warnings close together, you
probably have malware on your computer. Run a complete ClamWin scan
and then do can with a cleanup scanner, such as Malwarebytes Free
Antimalware or Microsoft Safety Scanner (msert.exe).</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">There is also an option to Skip Files
With A Valid Digital Signature. Once in a while, a malware will have
a valid digital signature (usually adware), but most files with a
valid digital signature are okay, so it is fairly safe to select this
option.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">N<B>otify Of New Versions</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The last Settings option is Notify of
new versions. If you choose this option, Sentinel will give you a pop
up message several minutes after turning on your computer if a new
version is available for downloading at the Sentinel web site. Turn
off the notification if it annoys you, and visit the Sentinel web
site once a month to see if there is a new version.</P>
<P><B>ADVANCED SETTINGS OPTIONS</B></P>
<P>The advanced settings options are for expert users who want to
&ldquo;tweak&rdquo; Sentinel. The configuration defaults that come
with Sentinel are best for most users.</P>
<P><B>Fixed Disks To Monitor</B></P>
<P>The first Advanced option is Choose fixed disks to monitor. This
is selected when you install Sentinel, but you can change it at any
time. Sentinel can monitor hard drives, network folders, CD drives
and USB/removable drives. Sentinel will normally automatically choose
to monitor the C drive You should monitor all other hard drives and
removable drives that you use regularly. USB drives are often named
drive F or G by the Windows operating system. The CD drive is often
called drive D or E.</P>
<P><B>Extensions To Scan</B></P>
<P>The next option is Choose what extensions Sentinel will scan. The
Sentinel default option has about 130 Windows file extensions.
Experienced users can configure their own custom scan extensions
here, but they will miss any future changes made to the default
extensions.</P>
<P><B>Paths Or Files Not Scanned (Whitelisting)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Operation: Disable System Monitor or
Stop Sentinel, Verify Files, Whitelist &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Files,
Re-Start/Enable</P>
<P>The next option is Paths or Files not scanned. Clam Sentinel comes
configured so that the path on your computer with the most recent
Windows activity is not scanned (whitelisted). You can add other
paths, or even individual files, that you do not want to be scanned
if they will trigger an unwanted Sentinel suspicious detection. You
can also whitelist infected file false positive detections until Clam
AV corrects their virus signature. Clam Sentinel has wild card
support (? and *) for filenames or paths not scanned. Files not
scanned are excluded from both the System monitor and the real-time
monitor, so be careful what you whitelist. Verify with Jotti or Virus
Total that each file you whitelist is not really infected.</P>
<P>Examples: c:\temp will exclude the temp folder from scans;
c:\temp\test.bat will exclude the test.bat program in the temp folder
from scans; test.bat will exclude the test.bat file anywhere on your
computer from scans. You can browse files/folders on your computer by
selecting the little icon on the whtelist configuration page. If you
use Clam Sentinel with another antivirus/antimalware program, you
should whitelist the other AVs program folder, data folder, and
quarantine folder and database folders (if separate from data folder)
from Clam Sentinel to prevent the other AV from triggering a false
detection on a ClamWin virus signature. Also exclude Clam Sentinel
and ClamWin program and data folders from the other scanner. This
option is also used to exclude files from Sentinel's System Monitor
warnings about suspicious files. If &ldquo;good&rdquo; programs that
you use trigger a System Monitor warning, you can whitelist these
files from the System Monitor so that future warnings will be only
for &ldquo;real&rdquo; suspicious files. If possible, exclude
individual files within a folder. Example:
C:\Foldername\Filename.Extension. Excluding entire folders will mean
less protection from both Sentinel's Real Time Monitor and the System
Monitor.</P>
<P><B>Paths Where All Files Will Be Scanned</B></P>
<P>The next option is Paths where all files will be scanned. This is
for selecting paths or directories, where all files are to be
scanned&mdash;regardless of the extensions. You can browse paths or
folders on your computer by selecting the little icon on the Sentinel
configuration page. You will generally not need this option.</P>
<P><B>Maximum No. Of Simultaneous Scans</B></P>
<P>The next option is Maximum number of simultaneously active scans.
Clam Sentinel comes configured with a 1 for this option, and most
users should use it. You might set it to 2 if you have a very large
hard drive or if your computer has a powerful dual processor and
ClamWin/Clam Sentinel are your only antivirus software.</P>
<P><B>Maximum Sentinel Log Size</B></P>
<P>The last advanced settings option is Maximum Sentinel log file
size. Clam Sentinel comes configured with a large 5 megabyte size,
but 1 or 2 megabytes is usually enough. There are 5 logs, and each
log has this same size.</P>
<P><B>Quarantine</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">There are two options under the
quarantine menu. You can access the quarantine folder or restore
quarantined files from here. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Access the quarantine folder to see
what files have been quarantined.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You can also run the Clam Sentinel
Quarantine Recover program to restore files from quarantine back to
their original location. Clam Sentinel comes with a separate program,
SentinelRecover.exe, which is similar to ClamWin's Quarantine Browser
program to restore files from quarantine. Sentinel Recover works on
all computers, and it can restore files quarantined by both Clam
Sentinel and ClamWin. Operation is simple, and the options are mostly
self explanatory. To restore files, you should follow the operation
steps above. Before restoring an infected file (not a System Monitor
suspicious file), you should visit the Clam AV Submit A File page on
the web to upload the file and tell Clam it is a false positive
detection so they can correct their signature. Then you can whitelist
the file for Clam Sentinel until it is corrected. If you intend to
scan a detected file with a ClamWin on-demand scan, you should also
whitelist it for ClamWin via the ClamWin filters tab. Remove the
whitelisted file from both Clam Sentinel and ClamWin whitelists when
Clam AV has corrected the signature in a few days. Never submit a
file detected by the System Monitor as &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; to
Clam AV because Clam can do nothing about false positive System
Monitor detections. Whitelist suspicious files for Clam Sentinel
only.</P>
<P><B>Logs</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">There are logs for the real-time
monitor, quarantined files, messages (System Monitor with some
registry changes if you used the full system monitor option), memory
scan, and drive scan. After &ldquo;whitelisting&rdquo; your &ldquo;good&rdquo;
files/folders that are detected as suspicious by Clam Sentinel , you
will normally not get many system monitor messages, so each message
can be important. Check the Message log occasionally to see if you
have missed anything. Recent messages are shown at the end of each
log.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You can locate any file warning by
looking at the System Monitor Message Log (the most recent files are
shown at the end of the log). Look at the Quarantine log to see
suspicious files put in the ClamWin Quarantine folder. 
</P>
<P><B>Using Clam Sentinel On A USB Drive With ClamWin On The Hard
Drive</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">ClamWin must be installed on the
computer the USB is plugged into, but it does not have to be
installed on the USB. Put the Clam Sentinel program folder on the USB
and put the .ini configuration file in the program folder. Manually
change the UseLocalIniFile in the Sentinel .ini configuration file to
UseLocalIniFile 1=yes. The 0 default puts the Sentinel configuration
file in C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Roaming\ClamSentinel for Windows
Vista/7/8 computers or in Documents and Settings for Windows XP
computers. Changing it to 1 will put the configuration file in the
Clam Sentinel program folder on the USB. The UseLocalIniFile setting
is the first item in the Sentinel .ini configuration file.</P>
<P><B>Using Both Clam Sentinel And ClamWin Portable On A USB Drive</B></P>
<P>First install <A HREF="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable">ClamWin
Portable</A> on a USB drive/key and start it (run ClamWinPortable.exe
from the ClamWinPortable directory). Configure ClamWin the way you
want. Not all normal ClamWin options are available in the Portable
version). 
</P>
<P>Then download the Clam Sentinel Zip file (or Sentinel.exe file)
from the Clam Sentinel web site to the desktop on your computer.
Extract the zipped Sentinel files to the desktop of your computer.
Then copy the Sentinel.exe file, the .ini file, and the Sentinel
Recover file to the USB drive in the ClamWinPortable\App\clamwin\bin
folder on the USB.</P>
<P>Next configure Clam Sentinel <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">to
use the .ini configuration file that is in the local folder from
where Sentinel is run (the ClamWin\bin directory on the USB). The
configuration item is UseLocalIniFile 1=yes. Do not use the zero
default. You can change the Sentinel.ini file in Notepad or a similar
text editor. Save the .ini file after making this change. The
UseLocalIniFile setting is the first item in the Sentinel .ini
configuration file. </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">You must also configure Clam Sentinel
to use the local ClamWin configuration file on the USB drive. To do
this, make the PathClamWin=..\..\..\data\settings active. Do this by
removing the semicolon (;) from the beginning of the line in the Clam
Sentinel .ini file and put a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the
line for any other &ldquo;PathClamWin=&rdquo; statements in the .ini
file. This configuration always works best for me if I put
PathClamWin=f:\ClamWinPortable\App\DefaultData\settings. The USB
drive is usually drive F or G, so change it as needed.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Do not run Clam Sentinel before
you make the two manual configuration changes mentioned above. </SPAN>Then
click on the Sentinel.exe file in the ClamWin bin folder to run Clam
Sentinel. You can do any other configuration via the Clam Sentinel
badge in the system tray after starting. You can then delete the Clam
Sentinel files on your desktop. 
</P>
<P>From now on, you can start Clam Sentinel on the USB by clicking on
the ClamSentinel.exe file in the ClamWin\bin folder on the USB, and
Clam Sentinel will start protecting you. I suggest that you do not
configure Clam Sentinel on the USB to run on startup&mdash;start it
manually each time you insert the USB. When you start Clam Sentinel,
it drops an icon in the system tray&mdash;just like it does for the
regular hard drive version. You can configure Clam Sentinel by
clicking on the icon&mdash;just like the regular version. Be sure to
enable the System Monitor to detect suspicious files only.</P>
<P>After Clam Sentinel is installed on the USB, you do not have to
start ClamWin Portable any more&mdash;Clam Sentinel will find the
ClamWin Portable files it needs on the USB key if you configure as
suggested. You do not need ClamWin Portable running in order to use
Clam Sentinel, but you should have both programs configured on USB as
mentioned. You will need to start ClamWin Portable, however, in order
to update the ClamWin signature database. Do this at least daily, but
more often if you use the internet a lot. 
</P>
<P>You can make a shortcut to Clam Sentinel on the USB and put it in
the ClamWinPortable folder/directory with the ClamWinPortable.exe
file. You could also make a shortcut to ClamWinPortable.exe and
ClamSentinel.exe on your desktop so that you can start them from your
desktop. CAUTION: before setting up or using ClamWinPortable and
ClamSentinel from the USB key, you will need to STOP them from
running if they are already installed on your hard drive. In fact, if
you want to run ClamWin and Sentinel from USB, it is best if you do
not have them installed locally on your hard drive. 
</P>
<P>You can stop both programs from running locally on the computer by
right clicking on their icons in the system tray and then selecting
Exit or Stop. When you want to remove the USB key from the computer,
you will have to stop Clam Sentinel on the USB (and ClamWinPortable
if it is running), and then click on the USB icon in the system tray
and stop the USB from running before you can remove it without doing
any damage to the USB.</P>
<P>Be sure to keep your old Sentinel.exe and .ini and Sentinel
Recover files from the USB when you update to a new version of
ClamWin Portable. When future updates to Clam Sentinel are available,
just copy the new Sentinel.exe file to the USB like you first did.
Your old Sentinel .ini file and Sentinel Recover file on the USB will
still be good, and Sentinel will update them during installation if
needed.</P>
<P><B>Thank You</B></P>
<P>Thank you for using Clam Sentinel. If you like it, please tell
other people about it, and give the author, Andrea Russo, your
comments and suggestions. Visit the Sentinel web site monthly for
news and updates.</P>
