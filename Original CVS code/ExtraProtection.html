<H3 CLASS="western">Getting Extra Protection With Clam Sentinel</H3>
<P>Start with the basics. Set ClamWin to update signatures hourly.
Use the latest versions of ClamWin and Clam Sentinel. Run a daily
ClamWin scan on memory, system 32 folder (and WOW folder on Windows
8), and the users/documents folder. Use these Clam Sentinel settings:
run on startup, detect and monitor new drives, quarantine infected
files, and set the system monitor to detect suspicious files
only--you do not need warnings of all system changes. Set your
computer for automatic Windows updates. 
</P>
<P>Keep your firewall turned on. The Microsoft firewall that comes
with XP/Vista/Windows 7 protects against unauthorized contacts
inbound from the web. It is difficult to configure for outbound
protection, but it is is simple, free, and &ldquo;quiet.&rdquo; There
is also a free software firewall for Windows XP and later computers
from Zone Alarm and maybe others. Zone Alarm version 6.1.744.001
works on Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>Configure your web browser to use any filters it has--such as pop
up blocking, tracking protection, phishing filter, smart download
protection, and malicious website protection. Keeping your browser
updated is more important than what browser you use. Some free
browser toolbars and add-ins provide additional web protection, but
stick to toolbars from well-known companies like Google, Microsoft,
Yahoo, or one of the antivirus companies. Stay away from web sites
offering porn, illegal/cracked software, and torrent downloads. Do
not give out personal information on social networking sites. 
</P>
<P>Malwarebytes' Anti Exploit (beta) provides free exploit protection
for users of Windows XP and newer systems. Malwarebytes also has a
free Antirootkit program (beta) that provides rootkit detection for
XP and newer systems.</P>
<P>Clam Sentinel detects many new malware files that might be
downloaded to your computer, but fast-acting malware can do damage
before it is quarantined. For extra protection, I recommend
Microsoft's free Security Essentials antivirus for Windows XP through
Windows 7 computers. To prevent AV confilicts, whitelist the ClamWin
and Clam Sentinel program folders, and ClamWin's data folder from
MSE's scans. If you decide not to use another real-time AV with
ClamWin/Sentinel, do a daily scan with Malwarebytes' free Antimalware
on Windows XP and newer computers. If your computer is older than
Windows XP, all I can suggest is that you do a daily scan with
ClamWin in Windows Safe Mode. Users should also get a free rescue CD
or USB for emergency use that boots up with its own operating system
that are available from some of the AV companies (such as F-Secure,
Dr. Web, eScan, or Kaspersky). I recommend Microsoft's free Windows
Defender Offline program that lets you make either a Windows rescue
CD or USB (get the USB). You must run rescue CD/USBs from a wired DSL
connection to properly update the malware signatures.</P>
<P>Finally, keep in mind that safe surfing and common sense provide
the best extra protection.</P>
<P>Please contact Andrea Russo, the Clam Sentinel developer, via the
Clam Sentinel web site if you have any comments about this article or
suggestions for improving Clam Sentinel. Delphi programmers can help
contribute to the Clam Sentinel project by contacting Andrea via the
